# Unity Script Templates

This repository is a bundle of the Script Templates I use in my Unity Projets.

## Setup Script templates in Unity

Script Templates are the scripts generated by Unity when you create a new C# Script for examples.

They are written in your Unity Installation, in `Editor/Data/Resources/ScriptTemplates`. 

Download or clone this repo into your Unity install folder. If your Unity editor is open when you set these files, close it and reopen it.
