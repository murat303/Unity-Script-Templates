# Unity Script Templates

This repository is a bundle of the Script Templates I use in my Unity Projets.

## Setup Script templates in Unity

Script Templates are the scripts generated by Unity when you create a new C# Script for examples.

They are written in your Unity Installation, in `Editor/Data/Resources/ScriptTemplates`. 

Download or clone this repo into your Unity install folder. If your Unity editor is open when you set these files, close it and reopen it.


## Script Templates naming

You can see that all the template scripts files have a specific naming syntax :

```
85-Other Scripts__Scriptable Object-MyClass.cs.txt
```

Let's see the composition of that... thing :

| 85 | Other Scripts | Scriptable Object | MyClass | .cs |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Menu position | Menu name | Submenu name | Default name of the new created file | Created file extension |
